A KNN model was used to classify Congress people as Democrat or Republican based on their 1984 United States Congressional voting record. 3 different methods for imputing missing values were tested. Imputation by using the mean of the training data subset was found to have the highest accuracy across several values of k (number of nearest neighbors). The highest accuracy achieved by this method was 95.14%, corresponding to 7 misclassified samples. Misclassified samples were analyzed and found to all have exactly 8 votes match the majority of the democratic party and an equal number of votes matching the majority of the republican party. This made it difficult for the model to correctly classify the samples which appeared to be equally distant from the two parties.
